The problem statement of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify radar images into six classes: drones, birds, clouds, fighter jet, passenger plane, and helicopter. This is a challenging task because radar images are often noisy, cluttered, and has low resolution. Moreover, different classes may have similar features or shapes, making them hard to distinguish. The goal of the project is to provide a reliable and efficient solution for soldiers working in the warfront, who need to quickly identify potential threats or targets from radar images.
The project consists of two main components: the machine learning model and the user interface. The machine learning model is based on CNN, which is a type of deep neural network that can learn hierarchical features from images. The model uses transfer learning of ResNet-50, which is a pre-trained CNN model that has achieved state-of-the-art results on various image recognition tasks. Transfer learning allows the model to leverage the knowledge learned from a large and diverse dataset, and adapt it to the specific domain of radar images. The user interface is a web-based application that enables users to interact with the machine learning model and get the classification results of radar images. The project demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of applying machine learning techniques for radar image analysis, and provides a valuable tool for soldiers working in the warfront. The project also shows the potential of using transfer learning to improve the performance of machine learning models on new domains and tasks. The project contributes to the field of computer vision and image processing, and has applications in various domains, such as military, security, aviation, and meteorology.
