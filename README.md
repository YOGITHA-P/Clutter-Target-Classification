The problem statement of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify radar images into six classes: drones, birds, clouds, fighter jet, passenger plane, and helicopter. This is a challenging task because radar images are often noisy, cluttered, and has low resolution. Moreover, different classes may have similar features or shapes, making them hard to distinguish. The goal of the project is to provide a reliable and efficient solution for soldiers working in the warfront, who need to quickly identify potential threats or targets from radar images.
